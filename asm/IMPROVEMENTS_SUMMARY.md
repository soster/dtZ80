# dtZ80 BIOS Improvements Implementation Summary

## Completed Fixes and Improvements

### 1. ✅ **CRITICAL: Fixed Syntax Error**
- **File:** `asm/dtz80-lib.inc`
- **Issue:** Removed erroneous standalone 'd' character in STARTUP_SOUND routine
- **Status:** FIXED - This was preventing assembly

### 2. ✅ **HIGH PRIORITY: Fixed Memory Map**
- **Files:** `asm/dtz80-lib.inc`, `asm/bios.asm`, `asm/debug-bios.inc`
- **Changes:**
  - Added proper memory map constants (ROM_START, ROM_END, RAM_START, RAM_END)
  - Set STACK_TOP to $FFEF (leaving space for I/O at top of memory)
  - Updated STACKPOINTER to use STACK_TOP
  - Fixed all references to use STACKPOINTER consistently
- **Status:** IMPLEMENTED

### 3. ✅ **HIGH PRIORITY: Improved Interrupt Handling**
- **File:** `asm/bios.asm`
- **Changes:**
  - Enhanced interrupt vector setup with better documentation
  - Improved interrupt mode 2 initialization
  - Added proper comments explaining vector calculation
- **Status:** IMPLEMENTED

### 4. ✅ **MEDIUM PRIORITY: Enhanced Error Handling**
- **File:** `asm/bios.asm`
- **Changes:**
  - Completely rewrote SPEC_RX_CONDITON handler
  - Added proper SIO error type detection (overrun, framing, parity)
  - Implemented specific error handling for each error type
  - Added proper register preservation and error cleanup
  - Added error reset command to clear SIO error flags
- **Status:** IMPLEMENTED

### 5. ✅ **MEDIUM PRIORITY: Improved LCD Library with Busy Flag Checking**
- **File:** `asm/lcd-lib.inc`
- **Changes:**
  - Replaced fixed delays with busy flag checking in LCD_WAIT
  - Added timeout protection to prevent infinite loops
  - Implemented fallback delay mechanism if busy flag fails
  - More reliable LCD communication
- **Status:** IMPLEMENTED

### 6. ✅ **Additional Improvements**
- **File:** `asm/dtz80-lib.inc`
- **Changes:**
  - Added system constants (BAUD_RATE, CPU_FREQ)
  - Better organization of constants
- **Status:** IMPLEMENTED

## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
Install rasm assembler:
```bash
# Download and install rasm from: https://github.com/mkoloberdin/rasm
```

### Assembly Test
```bash
cd asm
rasm bios.asm bios
```

### Simulation Test (if z88dk is available)
```bash
# Test with simulator
z88dk-ticks -iochar 5 bios.bin

# Test with symbols for debugging
rasm -s -sa bios.asm bios
z88dk-ticks -x bios.sym -pc 0 -d -iochar 5 bios.bin
```

## Key Benefits of These Improvements

### Reliability
- **Busy flag checking** makes LCD operations more reliable across different LCD modules
- **Enhanced error handling** prevents system crashes from serial communication errors
- **Proper memory map** prevents conflicts between ROM and RAM

### Maintainability
- **Better constants organization** makes code easier to understand and modify
- **Improved documentation** explains complex interrupt handling
- **Consistent naming** throughout the codebase

### Robustness
- **Timeout protection** prevents infinite loops in LCD operations
- **Proper error recovery** handles serial communication problems gracefully
- **Stack placement** leaves room for future I/O expansion

## Remaining Recommendations (Future Work)

### Low Priority Improvements
1. **Command Table System** - Implement table-driven command processing for easier expansion
2. **Memory Test Routines** - Add comprehensive POST tests
3. **Configuration Storage** - Add EEPROM support for storing settings
4. **Enhanced Sound Library** - Better AY-3-8910A support
5. **Watchdog Timer** - Add system reliability features

### Code Organization
1. **Modular Structure** - Separate hardware-specific code into modules
2. **Header Files** - Create proper header files with all constants
3. **Documentation** - Add comprehensive inline documentation

## Compatibility
All improvements maintain full compatibility with:
- RC2014 bus standard
- Existing hardware configuration
- Current I/O port assignments
- Serial communication protocols

## Files Modified
- `asm/bios.asm` - Main BIOS file
- `asm/dtz80-lib.inc` - Main library with constants and routines
- `asm/lcd-lib.inc` - LCD library with busy flag checking
- `asm/debug-bios.inc` - Debug BIOS for simulation
- `asm/bios-improvements.md` - Detailed improvement documentation

The BIOS should now be significantly more robust and reliable while maintaining all existing functionality.
